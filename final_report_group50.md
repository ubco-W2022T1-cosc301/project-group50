## **Introduction**

Because Heart disease is such a large problem in the United States, the data set we chose to analyze surrounds heart disease with data to calculate/analyze what factors in human health lead to an increased or decreased chance in heart disease. The data columns in our database include medical related tests such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol as well as data behind personal health choices such as smoker or non smoker and the patient's level of physical activity. This data set takes 22 columns of observations data into consideration and returns the tested results behind over 25,000 observations. This data is very well organized and will provide a great base for our project.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

Having chose a very rich dataset with lots of possibility for reasearch questions we were left with a variety of information that could be obsereved for our EDA. We explored things such as the total number of people with heart problems, the mean BMI value, the total number of women and men, and the number of rows and columns we were dealing with along with the number of unique values in each row.

Going into our EDA we also looked into the specific questions thats were asked to survey recepients to get these results which were the following:
* **HeartDiseaseorAttack:** Adults who have have a heart disease or a heart attack at some point.
* **HighBP:** Adults who have been told they have high blood pressure by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional.
* **HighChol:** Adults who have been told they're Cholesterol is high by a doctor, nurse or other health professional.
* **CholCheck:** Adults who have had a Cholesterol check within past five years.
* **BMI:** Calulated Body Mass Index.
* **Smoker:** Adults who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life.
* **Stroke:** Adults who have had a stroke.
* **Diabetes:** 0 = no diabetes, 1 = pre-diabetes, 2 = diabetes. (later filtered to diabetes or no diabetes on a 0-1 scale)
* **MentHlth:** On a scale of 0-30 answering how many days in the last 30 days the subject felt stress, depression, or problems with emotions.
* **PhysHlth:** Including physical illness and injury how many days in the last 30 days were recepients physical health not good.
* **Age:** On a scale of 1-13 with each integer representing a different age group as filtered below.
* **Fruits/Veggies:** Consumes fruits of veggies atleast once daily.
* **HvyAlcoholConsump:** Adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week.
* **DiffWalk:** Those who have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs.
* **GenHlth:** Recepient rating their health a scale of 1-5.
* **AnyHealthcare:** Whether or not recepient has access to any form of health care.
* **NoDocbcCost:** Whether or not recepient has no doctor because of the high cost.

Conducting this analysis gave us alot more insight into how we were going to be able to work with our data as we now knew more about things like the frequency of health factors and how the data could be used.



## Analysis 1: Colton Palfrey
 **Reasearch question:** What health factors relate the most to Heart problem/heart attacks?
For my research question I wanted to be able to figure out which of the data columns in our dataset coincided with the highest number of heart problems/heart attacks. Before beggining my analyses I had high predictions that recepients who had heart issues would also have had a high chance of having other health isseus such a stroke, high Cholesterol, Diabetes, or even a lack of physical activity. With my analysis complete and my diagrams to prove so I learned that recepients with heart problems had almost no notable coralation to strokes or diabetes and Instead I was able to see that smoking, high colesterol, and High blood pressure have the largest effect on those with heart conditions. My data showed that almost every single recepient with heart related issues received fequent Colesterol checks with many of them often returning a high colesterol value.

**Diagram 1:** Observing the graph below it appears as though people that have high blood pressure, high collesterol, and that are smokers all place very high in heart desease victims. I found these factors to all make alot of sense as these are all contributing factors to having lower health.

**Diagram 2:** Observations can be made off this next graph following the recepients who answered no as it appears as though most people with heart problems are not heavy drinkers and many have also never had a stroke or have diabetes. This is a telling factor that heart problems aren't highly related to the likelihood of someone having a stroke or being insulin dependent.

## Analysis 2: Justin Dilabio
 **Reasearch question:** How does BMI correlate to medical event and conditions?



## Analysis 3: Mitchell Alexander
 **Reasearch question:** What are the differences of health indicators between genders?
