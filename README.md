I am interested in knowing how various habits and conditions affect different aspects of ones health. For example how smoking affects ones cholesterol levels. The topic of the data invloves these variables. I plan to investigate, with my team, how these variables interact with each other.

=======
Because Heart disease is such a large problem in the United States, the data set we chose to analyze surrounds heart disease with data to calculate/analyze what factors in human health lead to an increased or decreased chance in heart disease. The data columns in our database include medical related tests such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol as well as data behind personal health choices such as smoker or non smoker and the patient's level of physical activity. This data set takes 22 columns of observations data into consideration and returns the tested results behind over 25,000 observations. This data is very well organized and will provide a great base for our project.
